Bactrian camel


The bactrian camel has a huge body, over 2 meters tall and weighing over 700 kg. The long hairs on the body are covered with short hairs that protect it from cold and heat. The large, attractive eyes have double eyelids and two rows of long, thick eyelashes. The nostrils have valves that open and close freely, and the small, round ear shells are filled with dense ear hairs.

They are well equipped to protect themselves from the wind and sand when it comes. The camels in China and the temperate desert areas of Central Asia are all bactrian camels. Bactrian camels are concentrated in the temperate deserts and desert grasslands of western Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Gansu. The number of wild bactrian camels in China is 95% of the world's population. And there are fewer wild bactrian camels than giant pandas in China, a rare and endangered animal. The most famous bactrian camel breeds in China are the Alxa camel and the Zunit camel.

Pantholops hodgsonii

The Tibetan antelope inhabits the alpine grasslands, meadows and alpine deserts at an altitude of 3700-5500 meters, foraging for food in the morning and evening and running well. They can form large herds of tens of thousands of individuals. In summer, the females migrate northward along a fixed route. Due to the year-round below zero environment, the whole body is dense fleece, for China's first-class protection of animals, has been established in Qiangtang, Cocoa Sicily, the northern part of the country. The Sanjiangyuan and other nature reserves are mainly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region of China (Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang) centered on the Qiangtang Plateau, with a few Found in the Ladakh region of China.

## Status of the population

The population has declined due to environmental degradation and poaching. Historically, the Tibetan antelope population has reached millions, but the international demand for the Tibetan antelope velvet Satush shawl has led to a decline in the population. They suffered heavy poaching in the last two decades of the 20th century and their numbers declined dramatically, with only 50,000 left in all of Tibet in 1995.

Over the years, Tibet has increased its protection of the Tibetan antelope, cracked down on the illegal hunting and killing of Tibetan antelope, and strengthened legal publicity and law enforcement. The Tibetan antelope population in Tibet has increased from 70,000 in 1999 to over 100,000 at present. As a result of the improvement of the ecological environment and the reduction of armed poaching activities, the population of Tibetan antelope has increased from 70,000 in 1999 to more than 100,000 at present in the Cocosili National Nature Reserve, the area where the antelope mainly lives. The Qiangtang National Nature Reserve in Tibet, the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve in Qinghai and the Arjinshan National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang. The survival rate of newborn small Tibetan antelope has improved and the population has recovered with rapid growth, reaching nearly 300,000 individuals by 2014.

## Protection measures

The Tibetan antelope is protected through the establishment of protected areas, the fight against poaching, and legislative conventions.

Sumatran tiger

The Sumatran tiger is the smallest surviving subspecies of tiger. The Sumatran tiger has the darkest coat of all tigers and its black stripes are distinctive, with small intervals between stripes, and are often Arranged in pairs, also with stripes on the front legs. It is found only on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Habitat ranges from plain forests to high mountains. There are only about 400-500 Sumatran tigers remaining in the wild, mainly in the five national parks on the island of Indonesia.

## Endangered causes

### Habitat destruction
Long before 1990, APP (Asia Pulp & Paper, the Asian Pulp and Paper Corporation) was opened a factory in Sumatra, Indonesia. The world environmental organization had demanded that APP and other paper companies immediately stop the destruction of Sumatra's forests because the destruction of the forests caused The massive loss of habitat for the Sumatran tiger, which has put them on the brink of extinction.

### Overhunting
Tiger hunting has always been rampant in Sumatra. In the local streets, tiger bones, claws, skins and other tiger products can be found for sale everywhere.

Polar bear

The polar bear, a member of the Ursidae family, is the world's largest land carnivore, also known as the white bear. Their skin is black, and their fur is usually white due to its transparent appearance, but can also be yellow and other colors. Polar bears' vision and hearing are comparable to humans, but their sense of smell is extremely sensitive, seven times that of dogs; the fastest speed when running is up to 60km/h, 1.5 times the world 100m champion. Due to rising global temperatures, the ice floes in the Arctic are gradually beginning to melt, and the polar bears' former home has been destroyed to some extent in the It is likely to become extinct in the near future and will require human protection.

Polar bears are not harmless to humans, but they are threatened by unrestricted hunting and killing. The main threats to polar bears are pollution, poaching, and disturbance from industrial activities. While the effects of climate change are uncertain, it is recognized that even minor climate change may have a negative impact on polar bears' sea ice habitat have far-reaching impacts. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) also pose a threat to polar bears. Studies of accumulation of organochlorine pesticides have shown that polar bears, as apex predators, are at risk of accumulating these compounds in their bodies, including. Nervous system, reproductive and immune functions.
